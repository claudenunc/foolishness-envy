# Plan Build 11: Automatic Zoom Coordination System

## Core Objective
Design and implement an "Automatic Zoom" capability inside the Agent Operating System that auto-schedules, launches, and manages synchronous video sessions for eNVy-led experiences across FooLiSHNeSS eNVy education programs, Skellington Records collaborations, and The Rise of the Agent Age community. The system must minimize founder overhead while delivering a branded, human-centric experience that reinforces our mission of unity, creativity, and purpose.

## Strategic Lens
- **Ethical & Human-Centered:** Respect participant privacy, provide transparency about automation, and maintain optional manual override.
- **Cultural Power:** Infuse FooLiSHNeSS eNVy storytelling elements (audio branding, ritual intros) into every touchpoint.
- **Scalable & Modular:** Build reusable components that extend to future synchronous platforms (Google Meet, Spaces) without rework.
- **Revenue-Ready:** Instrument pricing hooks (tiered cohorts, sponsorship overlays) from day one to shorten path to monetization.

## Key Outcomes
1. Automated calendar coordination for target cohorts with personalized invites.
2. Seamless Zoom session provisioning with branded lobby assets.
3. AI-assistant guided pre-call prep and post-call knowledge capture.
4. Analytics dashboard surfaced within Agent OS for ongoing optimization.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Zoom Admin access with API credentials and ability to manage sub-accounts/webinars.
- Existing CRM/Community roster stored in Airtable or Notion with tags for cohorts.
- Agent OS core services (identity, notification, task orchestration) available via internal APIs.
- Legal review for recording consent already standardized (template available).
- Creative assets (audio idents, motion loops, typography styles) curated by Skellington Records brand team.
- Analytics stack (PostHog + Supabase) provisioned for capturing engagement signals.

## MVP Scope vs. Future Enhancements
- **MVP (Build 11):** Automated scheduling, Zoom provisioning, ritualized communications, compliance guardrails, analytics dashboard, AI-powered summaries.
- **Future Enhancements:** Multi-platform expansion (Google Meet, Spaces), adaptive facilitation agent, commerce hooks for paid drop-ins, NFT-gated experiences, integration with Skellington Records livestream pipelines.

## Tech Stack Commitments
- **Backend:** TypeScript + NestJS services orchestrated via Temporal for workflows.
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind UI for coordinator portal and lobby experiences.
- **Data Layer:** Supabase Postgres with row-level security, nightly sync to Airtable views.
- **Messaging:** Postmark for email, Twilio for SMS, Discord webhooks for community pings.
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI Assistants for prep digests and recap summaries, ElevenLabs for ritual voiceovers.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (ECS Fargate + RDS), Terraform managed by DevOps Agent.

### Phase 2 – Scheduling Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)
- Develop Scheduling Agent leveraging rule engine (Temporal/Prefect) to generate recurring sessions.
- Integrate participant availability import (calendar sync + manual overrides).
- Create conflict resolution logic (priority scoring, fallback slots, human escalation).
- Deliver internal dashboard to visualize schedule and manually adjust.

## Risk Radar (Expanded)
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement exponential backoff and job queue retries; pre-cache recurring meetings weekly to reduce bursts.
- **Data Privacy:** Encrypt sensitive participant data at rest and in transit; offer data deletion self-service; annual penetration test with third-party partner.
- **Change Management:** Provide training + office hours; maintain manual override controls; embed in-community ambassadors to champion adoption.
- **Cultural Drift:** Ritual Composer uses curated content library reviewed by creative director each quarter; instrumentation flags sessions missing ritual elements for follow-up.
- **AI Misalignment:** Human-in-the-loop review for AI-generated prep digests and recaps until precision surpasses 95% accuracy threshold.

## Success Metrics
- 90% of scheduled sessions launch without manual intervention during pilot.
- Host preparation time reduced by 70% compared to baseline.
- Participant satisfaction (post-call survey) averages 4.6/5.
- Zero compliance incidents; consent coverage at 100%.
- Sponsorship-ready cohorts identified within 30 days of launch with clear engagement story.

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
1. Secure Zoom developer credentials and confirm scopes.
2. Inventory cohort rosters and assess data cleanliness.
3. Draft brand-guided notification scripts with storytelling hooks.
4. Schedule architecture workshop with core agents to finalize data contracts.
5. Define pilot cohort success criteria (qualitative + quantitative) and align with mission narrative.
6. Spin up shared Miro/Figma board for ritual experimentation and asset approvals.

## Open Questions Requiring Founder Input
1. Preferred balance between automation and live human facilitation for sensitive rituals?
2. Sponsorship guardrails: which brands are mission-aligned vs. off-limits?
3. Data residency requirements for global cohorts (EU/UK participants)?
4. What KPIs matter most for upcoming investor storytelling around Agent OS?
