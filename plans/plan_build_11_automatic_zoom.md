# Plan Build 11: Automatic Zoom Coordination System

## Core Objective
Design and implement an "Automatic Zoom" capability inside the Agent Operating System that auto-schedules, launches, and manages synchronous video sessions for eNVy-led experiences across FooLiSHNeSS eNVy education programs, Skellington Records collaborations, and The Rise of the Agent Age community. The system must minimize founder overhead while delivering a branded, human-centric experience that reinforces our mission of unity, creativity, and purpose.

## Strategic Lens
- **Ethical & Human-Centered:** Respect participant privacy, provide transparency about automation, and maintain optional manual override.
- **Cultural Power:** Infuse FooLiSHNeSS eNVy storytelling elements (audio branding, ritual intros) into every touchpoint.
- **Scalable & Modular:** Build reusable components that extend to future synchronous platforms (Google Meet, Spaces) without rework.

## Key Outcomes
1. Automated calendar coordination for target cohorts with personalized invites.
2. Seamless Zoom session provisioning with branded lobby assets.
3. AI-assistant guided pre-call prep and post-call knowledge capture.
4. Analytics dashboard surfaced within Agent OS for ongoing optimization.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Zoom Admin access with API credentials and ability to manage sub-accounts/webinars.
- Existing CRM/Community roster stored in Airtable or Notion with tags for cohorts.
- Agent OS core services (identity, notification, task orchestration) available via internal APIs.
- Legal review for recording consent already standardized (template available).

## Architecture Overview
| Layer | Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experience | Cohort Coordinator Portal | Configure program cadence, templates, content |
| Experience | Participant Touchpoints | Email/SMS/Discord notifications, landing pages |
| Intelligence | Scheduling Agent | Reconciles availability, program cadence, and constraints |
| Intelligence | Ritual Composer | Injects scripted intros/outros, playlists, prompts |
| Integration | Zoom Service Adapter | Handles meeting creation, updates, and webhooks |
| Integration | Calendar Connectors | Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal feeds |
| Data | Cohort Registry | Tracks member status, access rights, attendance |
| Data | Session Journal | Stores agendas, notes, recordings metadata |
| Ops | Compliance Guard | Consent tracking, retention policies |
| Ops | Metrics Pipeline | Aggregates usage, engagement, NPS |

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 – Discovery & Alignment (Week 0)
- Conduct 3 founder interviews to capture ritual requirements and brand tone.
- Audit current scheduling tools, manual workflows, and contact databases.
- Confirm legal/compliance constraints for recording and data storage.

### Phase 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Provision secure secrets management for Zoom and calendar APIs.
- Implement Cohort Registry schema (Postgres or Airtable sync) with tags for program, timezone, role.
- Build Zoom Service Adapter with create/update/delete meeting endpoints plus webhook listeners.
- Set up Compliance Guard baseline: consent flag fields, retention timers.

### Phase 2 – Scheduling Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)
- Develop Scheduling Agent leveraging rule engine (Temporal/Prefect) to generate recurring sessions.
- Integrate participant availability import (calendar sync + manual overrides).
- Create conflict resolution logic (priority scoring, fallback slots, human escalation).
- Deliver internal dashboard to visualize schedule and manually adjust.

### Phase 3 – Experience Layer (Weeks 5-6)
- Design Participant Touchpoint templates (emails, SMS, Discord) with FooLiSHNeSS storytelling.
- Implement Ritual Composer to assemble intros/outros, playlists, and prompts based on session type.
- Build branded lobby page with program-specific assets and onboarding checklist.
- Enable pre-call AI prep digest (agenda + personalized action items) delivered 24h prior.

### Phase 4 – Session Orchestration (Weeks 7-8)
- Automate Zoom meeting start reminders for hosts, including checklists and asset links.
- Capture live session metadata via Zoom webhooks (attendance, duration, recording links).
- Trigger post-call workflows: note transcription, highlight reel generation, follow-up tasks.
- Update Session Journal and push summaries to Agent OS knowledge base.

### Phase 5 – Analytics & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
- Build metrics pipeline capturing attendance rate, engagement signals (chat, poll usage), NPS.
- Surface analytics dashboard inside Agent OS with cohort comparisons and trend alerts.
- Implement feedback loop for Scheduling Agent to adjust cadence based on participation.

### Phase 6 – Launch & Iteration (Week 11)
- Pilot with two cohorts (education + artist collaboration) for 2-week cycle.
- Run daily standups reviewing automation performance, manual overrides, user sentiment.
- Finalize documentation, SOPs, and training videos for operator handoff.
- Define backlog for cross-platform expansion (automatic Google Meet, Twitter Spaces).

## Multi-Agent Execution Map
| Agent | Responsibilities | Handoffs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Research Strategist | Validate micro-trends in community-based learning & virtual studio collabs | Feeds insights to UX Empath & Market Analyst |
| Product Feasibility Analyst | Vet Zoom API limits, webhook reliability, scalability | Flags constraints to Architecture Lead |
| Market Analyst | Quantify monetization pathways (premium cohorts, sponsorships) | Provides pricing insights to Launch Agent |
| UX Empath | Prototype participant journey, ensure accessibility & inclusivity | Supplies requirements to Frontend Agent |
| Solution Architect | Define system diagram, data contracts, security patterns | Coordinates Backend, Infra, DevOps |
| Frontend Agent | Build portal UI, lobby pages, notification templates | Works with UX Empath |
| Backend/API Agent | Implement scheduling logic, service adapters, webhook handlers | Collaborates with Database & DevOps |
| Database/Infrastructure Agent | Manage schemas, migrations, backups | Ensures compliance |
| DevOps Agent | CI/CD, secrets rotation, monitoring, incident response | Supports entire team |
| Marketing/Launch Agent | Craft narrative, launch assets, partner outreach | Aligns with mission messaging |

## Success Metrics
- 90% of scheduled sessions launch without manual intervention during pilot.
- Host preparation time reduced by 70% compared to baseline.
- Participant satisfaction (post-call survey) averages 4.6/5.
- Zero compliance incidents; consent coverage at 100%.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement exponential backoff and job queue retries.
- **Data Privacy:** Encrypt sensitive participant data at rest and in transit; offer data deletion self-service.
- **Change Management:** Provide training + office hours; maintain manual override controls.
- **Cultural Drift:** Ritual Composer uses curated content library reviewed by creative director each quarter.

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
1. Secure Zoom developer credentials and confirm scopes.
2. Inventory cohort rosters and assess data cleanliness.
3. Draft brand-guided notification scripts with storytelling hooks.
4. Schedule architecture workshop with core agents to finalize data contracts.
